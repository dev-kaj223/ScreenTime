# 🛡️ TimeGuard

> **Quietly protect your kids' screen time — without the arguments.**

A lightweight Windows parental screen-time manager that runs silently in the background, enforces per-app daily limits with optional weekday-specific schedules, restricts apps to allowed time-of-day windows, enforces mandatory break schedules, and blocks relaunches once limits are hit. Limits reset at midnight. 🌙

[![Build & Package](https://github.com/debmis/TimeGuard/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/debmis/TimeGuard/actions/workflows/build.yml)
[![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/debmis/TimeGuard?label=latest%20release)](https://github.com/debmis/TimeGuard/releases/latest)

**[📦 Download latest TimeGuard-win-x64.zip](https://github.com/debmis/TimeGuard/releases/latest/download/TimeGuard-win-x64.zip)**

> Single-file self-contained executable — no .NET runtime required. Extract and run `TimeGuard.exe`.
> Can't find the link above? Browse [all releases](https://github.com/debmis/TimeGuard/releases) or grab a short-lived build artifact from the [Actions tab](https://github.com/debmis/TimeGuard/actions/workflows/build.yml).

### 🚀 Quick Start

1. Download and extract **TimeGuard-win-x64.zip** to a permanent folder, e.g.:
   ```
   C:\Program Files\TimeGuard\
   ```
2. Run **TimeGuard.exe** — a setup wizard will appear to set your parent password 🔐
3. That's it! TimeGuard registers itself to **start automatically with Windows** and runs silently in the background 🎉

> ⚠️ Pick your permanent folder *before* first run. Moving the exe later breaks the auto-start entry (re-register via Settings → Security tab).

### ⌨️ Opening Settings

Press **Ctrl + Alt + Shift + G** at any time to open the parent settings panel (password required).

- ⏱️ **Per-app daily time limits** + an overall daily cap across all apps
- 📅 **Weekday-specific schedules** — set different daily limits and allowed windows for each day
- 🕐 **Time-of-day windows** — allow apps only between certain hours
- ☕ **Mandatory break schedules** per app (e.g. 5-min break every 30 min)
- ⚠️ **5-minute warning popup** before a limit expires
- 🖥️ **Fullscreen break overlay** with countdown that covers all monitors and blocks all input
- 🚫 **Blocks relaunches** once the limit is hit — with a friendly "Time's up" message
- 📊 **History dashboard** with 7-day bar chart and per-day drilldown
- 🔒 **Password-protected settings** panel opened via global hotkey

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- C# / .NET 8, WPF (Windows only)
- SQLite via `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite` + `Dapper`
- OxyPlot.Wpf for the history dashboard chart
- xUnit for unit tests + FlaUI (Windows UI Automation) for end-to-end UI tests

## 🛠️ Build & Run

```bash
# Build entire solution
dotnet build

# Run the app (debug)
dotnet run --project src/TimeGuard.App

# Run all tests (unit + UI automation)
dotnet test

# Run only unit tests
dotnet test tests/TimeGuard.Tests

# Run only UI automation tests (launches the real app)
dotnet test tests/TimeGuard.UITests

# Filter by test class or method
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~RulesEngineTests"
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~RulesEngineTests.Block_WhenAtLimit"

# Publish as single-file framework-dependent .exe
dotnet publish src/TimeGuard.App -r win-x64 --no-self-contained -p:PublishSingleFile=true -c Release -o publish/
```

### 🔁 Auto-run UI tests on save

`watch.ps1` at the repo root watches `*.cs` / `*.xaml` files and re-runs the UI test suite automatically on every save:

```powershell
# Default — uses "test123" as the parent password in tests
.\watch.ps1

# Use your own password (must match the password in your test DB)
.\watch.ps1 -Password "mypassword"
```

> **Note:** UI automation tests launch a real `TimeGuard.exe` process against a throw-away temp SQLite database, so they never touch your real `%AppData%\TimeGuard\timeguard.db`. The app must be built (`dotnet build`) before running the tests — or just run `dotnet test` which builds automatically.

## 🗄️ Data Storage (SQLite)

All data lives in `%AppData%\TimeGuard\timeguard.db`.

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Settings` | Key-value store — password hash, hotkey, overall daily cap |
| `AppRules` | Per-app rules: identity, break schedule, enabled flag, and legacy uniform schedule fields |
| `AppRuleDaySchedules` | Per-app weekday schedules: daily limit and allowed window for each day |
| `DailyUsage` | Per-app usage in minutes per calendar day, blocked flag |
| `Sessions` | Running session tracking used for break timer accumulation |

Schema is created automatically by `DatabaseMigrator` on first run.

## ☕ Break Schedule

Each app rule can optionally configure:
- **Break every N minutes** — how often a break is required
- **Break duration M minutes** — how long the break must last

When a break is due, the app isn't killed — instead a fullscreen countdown overlay appears that covers all monitors and cannot be dismissed. The break timer resets automatically when the overlay closes.
